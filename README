# CSCI-GA 2433 2024 Fall Final Project

## Project Overview
This is the **Final Project** for CSCI-GA 2433 (Software Engineering) in Fall 2024. The project implements a **small-scale backend server** for a music streaming application using **Python Flask** and integrates an **SQLite database** to support various use cases.

In this project, we have built several essential features for a music streaming service, including:

- User registration and login
- Music search
- Music playback
- Playlist management
- Song rating and commenting

This server is designed to handle basic interactions typically found in a music streaming platform, and it's built to be lightweight and easy to run locally.

## Features
- **User Registration & Login**: Users can register an account and log in to access personalized features.
- **Music Search**: Allows users to search for songs by title, artist, or album.
- **Music Playback**: Users can listen to songs directly from the server.
- **Playlist Management**: Users can create, edit, and manage playlists.
- **Song Rating & Comments**: Users can rate songs and leave comments, helping others discover new music.
